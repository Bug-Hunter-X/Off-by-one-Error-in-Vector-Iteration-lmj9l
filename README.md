# Off-by-One Error in Vector Iteration
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= vec.size()` attempts to access an element beyond the valid range of indices (0 to `vec.size()-1`).  The solution shows how to correctly iterate using `<` instead of `<=`.
